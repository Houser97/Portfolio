My portfolio was created with React, pure CSS and the GSAP dependency to create the animations that are activated according to the scroll. It presents 4 projects that I created during my apprenticeship in web development following the curriculum given by The Odin Project.

The portfolio consists of a presentation section, in which the animation was defined with the transform and opacity property in CSS.

Next is the About section, in which I talk about myself and show the technologies that I have learned during my journey in this learning.

Then, the projects section is presented, where each project has a description of its functionality as well as the technologies used for its creation. Finally, there is the Footer to present my contact.
